```

A browser window will open and display the dashboard, similar to the screenshot above.

To run in a REPL, evaluate the `practicalli.covid19-dashboard` namespace, then evaluate a call to the `-main` function, e.g. `(-main)`

Read the `src/practicalli/design_journal.clj` file to follow the evolution of the design of the application.


## Updating the data
The latest covid cases and deaths data is available from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/
